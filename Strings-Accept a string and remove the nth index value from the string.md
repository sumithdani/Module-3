# Module-3
# 🧹 Strings-Remove Nth Index Character from a String

##  Aim
To write a Python program that accepts a string and removes the character at a specified index.

##  Algorithm
1. Define a function named `remove` that takes the input string as an argument.
2. Read the index `n` from the user input.
3. Initialize an empty string `a` to store the new string.
4. Iterate over each index of the string using a `for` loop.
5. Check if the current index `i` is not equal to `n`.
6. If `i != n`, append the character at index `i` to string `a`.
7. After the loop, return the modified string `a`.
8. Print the final result.

## 💻 Program
```
s = input()
n = int(input())
s = s[:n] + s[n+1:]
print(s)
```

## Output

## Result
Thus, the Python program to accept a string and remove the character at a specified index was executed successfully, and the modified string was obtained.
